# Cloud Saves Desktop application

[![semantic-release: electron](https://img.shields.io/badge/semantic--release-electron-31a0f9?logo=semantic-release)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

Desktop application for management of game saves.

Backend application with REST API is implemented by my friend https://github.com/Ki-Really/GameSavesStore.

In our time, video games have become an important part of leisure for millions of people around the world. It often happens that game save files are lost due to various reasons: computer crashes, accidental deletion of data, and other causes.

There are cloud storage solutions for game save files, such as Steam and GOG Launcher. In addition to synchronizing game save files, they can extract parameters such as time spent in the game, game completion percentage, and others from the files.

The main problem with these applications is that they only support games purchased within the Steam and Good Old Games digital stores. This creates a need for a system that backs up game save files for arbitrary games.

## Features

- üîç scan file system for game saves
- üîÑ periodically sync saves with server
- ‚¨áÔ∏é download your/shared/public saves
- üóÉÔ∏è extract game state information from files (player level, play time etc)

npx tsuml2 -o out.svg  -g "./src/**/*.ts(x)?"
```

## Folder structure

We use electron as a framework, so application consists of two parts: **"backend"** application which runs on Node.js and **client** application which runs in chromium.

- src - root of source directory
  - @types - global type definitions
  - backend - "backend" application
    - fs - fs utils
    - game-state-parameters - parameter values extraction, game state formats convertion
    - StatesManager - extracts parameter values, archives game state files, downloads game state from the server
    - SyncManager - automatically uploads or downloads game states
    - electron-api.ts - IPC handlers (smth like REST controller)
  - client - client application
    - app - configuration of react application (main layout, routing etc)
    - config - configuration of application (list of pages, their corresponding paths, sidebar links)
    - locales - json files with internationalized texts
    - pages - pages
    - entities - entity specific components
    - shared - reusable domain/app specific code (components, hooks, other utils)
    - ui - ui kit. This layer knows nothing about domain or application as a whole.
    - api - api layer or data access layer (DAL) (work with REST API, electron IPC)
  - preload.ts - Electron preload file
  - renderer.ts - Entry point of client application
  - main.ts - Entry point of a whole application
  - types.ts - Domain specific type definitions
  - Application.ts - Configuration and bootstrap of a whole application
