## Folder structure

We use electron as a framework, so application consists of two parts: **"backend"** application which runs on Node.js and **client** application which runs in chromium.

- src - root of source directory
  - @types - global type definitions
  - backend - "backend" application
    - fs - fs utils
    - game-state-parameters - parameter values extraction, game state formats convertion
    - StatesManager - extracts parameter values, archives game state files, downloads game state from the server
    - SyncManager - automatically uploads or downloads game states
    - electron-api.ts - IPC handlers (smth like REST controller)
  - client - client application
    - app - configuration of react application (main layout, routing etc)
    - config - configuration of application (list of pages, their corresponding paths, sidebar links)
    - locales - json files with internationalized texts
    - pages - pages
    - entities - entity specific components
    - shared - reusable domain/app specific code (components, hooks, other utils)
    - ui - ui kit. This layer knows nothing about domain or application as a whole.
    - api - api layer or data access layer (DAL) (work with REST API, electron IPC)
  - preload.ts - Electron preload file
  - renderer.ts - Entry point of client application
  - main.ts - Entry point of a whole application
  - types.ts - Domain specific type definitions
  - Application.ts - Configuration and bootstrap of a whole application
